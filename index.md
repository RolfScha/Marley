H1 This is about the movie "My friend Marley"
In this movie there is a dog from it's early years to the end. It is very funny, with lots of slapstick moments in his family. As you can imagine, you can laugh a lot until the time proceeds to the dogs elder days. It ends with the moment when Marley dies. I think it is really a great movie.
